## How to Run the Solution

To run the solution, follow these steps:

1. **Run the main script:**

   First, execute the `main.py` script to start the program:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Make a POST request using the test script:**

   After running the main script, use the `test.py` script to make a POST request. Provide the name of the JSON file you wish to test as an argument:

   ```bash
   python test.py payload.json
   ```

  The result will be returned and saved in the response.json file.
